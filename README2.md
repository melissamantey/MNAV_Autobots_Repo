# MNAV Autobots Repository
This is a repository for the code that updates the Registry used in the MNAV Project.

# Directories
1. php
2. scripts
3. SQLfiles
4. textfiles

# The php Directory
This directory
This file is generated by a python script that pulls data from the gps. It is updated with lines of comma separated data. Each line contains:
1. Latitude
2. Longitude
3. Time

# The scripts Directory



This file should be called like so:
	'./gps_registry_script.sh gps_data.txt'
The file runs the gps python file that generates latitude, longitude, and time. It takes the data generated by the gps and stores in in the registry using the 'update_registry.php' file.

#parse_gps.sh
This file should be called with the following command './parse_gps.sh'. As it stands, it will export latitude, longitude and time in that order to the file 'test.txt'
